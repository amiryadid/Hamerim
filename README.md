In case you want to seed the database once more:
Run Update-Database in the Package Manager Console

In case you just cloned the project:
Make sure you have an App_Data folder in the file explorer - not with the VS file explorer! (if not, create one manually)
Then run Update-Database (if you already ran the project on your computer in the past, make sure you delete the old DB from SQL management studio beforehand)
